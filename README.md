## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a> <br>

Just For Funsies is a Unity project. It's a place for me to try out all the cool game dev things that I see in other games. It's also a place to practice good game architecture, game programming patterns and a lot of other stuff. Maybe it will end up being an actual game, maybe not. It will also keep my github slightly cleaner without a bunch of new projects for trying different things.

Just For Funsies was created using Unity Version 2020.2.3f1
